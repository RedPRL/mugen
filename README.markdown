# ðŸŒŒ Universe Levels

An overly functorized implementation of [Conor McBrideâ€™s crude but effective stratification](https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/Crude.pdf) and its slight generalization.

## Stability

âš  The API is experimental and unstable. We will break things!

## Components

- [Mugenjou.Shift](https://redprl.org/mugenjou/mugenjou/Mugenjou/Shift): classes of level shifting operators
- [Mugenjou.Syntax](https://redprl.org/mugenjou/mugenjou/Mugenjou/Syntax): universe levels
- [Mugenjou.Builder](https://redprl.org/mugenjou/mugenjou/Mugenjou/Builder): smart builders of universe levels
- [Mugenjou.Theory](https://redprl.org/mugenjou/mugenjou/Mugenjou/Theory): comparators for universe levels

## Philosophy and Beliefs in this Experiment

1. The distinguished level variable should be made explicit so that everything has clear semantics.
2. One-variable universe polymorphism with cumulativity is enough. Typical ambiguity (as in Coq) and multi-variable universe polymorphism (as in Agda) are overkill.
3. It is convenient to have the top level.

## Classes of Level Shifting Operators

In Conor McBrideâ€™s notes, it was noted that any class of strictly monotone operators on levels closed under identity and composition will work. Initially, the class of functions `f(i) = i + n` for `n >= 0` was chosen as it is practically the minimum usable class. We are additionally considering a larger class of strictly monotone functions `f` such that `f(i) = i + n` when `i >= k` for some finite `k` (when `i < k`, the function `f` is still strictly monotone, but may differ from `fâ€™(i) = i + n`). Both classes are implemented in this package. We are eager to experiment with any class that arises from practical needs.

- [Mugenjou.Shift.Crude](https://redprl.org/mugenjou/mugenjou/Mugenjou/Shift/Crude): the class of functions `f(i) = i + n`.
- [Mugenjou.Shift.Gapped](https://redprl.org/mugenjou/mugenjou/Mugenjou/Shift/Gapped): the class of monotone functions that agree with `f(i) = i + n` for `i > k`.

## How to Use It

### OCaml >= 4.12

You need OCaml 4.12 or later

### Example Code

```ocaml
module MS = Mugenjou.Shift
module M = Mugenjou.Syntax

type ulevel = (MS.crude, string) M.free

let l : ulevel = M.Free.(shifted (var "x") (MS.Crude.const 10))
```
